# What is WebHook and how can we test it with github and jenkins 

* A webhook is a way for one application to notify another application automatically when a certain event occurs.
* GitHub and Jenkins are both tools commonly used in software development, and they can be integrated using webhooks to automate various tasks,    such as triggering builds in Jenkins whenever code changes are pushed to a GitHub repository.
